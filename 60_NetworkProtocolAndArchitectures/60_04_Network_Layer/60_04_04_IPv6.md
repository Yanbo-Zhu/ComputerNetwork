## 1.1 IPv6: motivation
initial motivation: 32 bit IPv4 address space would be completely allocated

additional motivation:
- ==speed processing/forwarding==: 40 byte fixed length header
- enable different network layer treatment of “flows”


## 1.2 IPv6 datagram format

what's missing 中定义了  那些 bits 不存在了 , in comprision of ipv6


### 1.2.1 IP fragmentation/reassembly

## 1.3 Transition from IPv4 to IPv6 through tunneling


tunneling: IPv6 datagram carried as payload in IPv4 datagram among IPv4 routers (“packet within a packet”)
tunneling used extensively in other contexts (4G/5G)
