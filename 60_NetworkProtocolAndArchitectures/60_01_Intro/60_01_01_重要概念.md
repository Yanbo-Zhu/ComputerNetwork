The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Reference Model
- Physical layer: 
    - Transmit raw bits over a physical medium
    - Manages hardware connections, signaling, and data transmission over physical media
    - Includes cables or the air interface
- Data Link layer: 
    - Provide a (more or less) error-free transmission service for data frames - also over a shared medium!
    - Provides error detection and correction
    - Divides data into frames for physical transmission
    - Establishes together with Layer 1 local, interconnecting, or brodcast networks
- Network layer: 
    - Solve the forwarding and routing problem for a network - bring data to a desired host
    - Handles addressing and routing between networks
- Transport layer: 
    - Provide (possibly reliable, in order) end-to-end communication, overload protection, fragmentation to processes “Bringing data from process A to B with sufficient quality”
    - Ensures reliable delivery of data between end devices
    - Manages error recovery, fl ow control, and segmentation
- Session layer: 
    - Group communication into sessions which can be synchronized, checkpointed, …
    - Manages sessions between applications, including initiation, maintenance, and termination
- Presentation layer: 
    - Ensure that syntax and semantic of data is uniform between all types of terminals
    - Formats, Translates, encrypts, or compresses data for the application layer
- Application layer: 
    - Actual application, e.g., protocols to transport web pages
    - Interface for network applications to access network services



TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) Model

Host-to-Network
- Combines the OSI Physical and Data Link Layers
- Responsible for hardware addressing and physical data transmission

Internet Layer
- Maps to the OSI Network Layer
- Handles logical addressing and routing between end-devices

Transport Layer
- Matches the OSI Transport Layer
- Provides reliable (TCP) or unreliable (UDP) communication

Application Layer
- Combines the OSI Application, Presentation, and Session Layers
- Provides network service directly to applications


# 2 Protocol 

- Network Layer - Transfer bits and bytes
    - IP (Internet Protocol): Transfer bytes. Unreliable.
- Transport Layer - Are the bits and bytes transferred properly?
    - TCP (Transmission Control): Reliability > Performance
    - TLS (Transport Layer Security): Secure TCP
    - UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Performance > Reliability
- Application Layer - Make REST API calls and Send Emails
    - HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Stateless Request
    - Response Cycle
    - HTTPS: Secure HTTP
    - SMTP: Email Transfer Protocol

Hostname <->  IP Address
- From alphanumerical name to IP address: Domain Name System (DNS)

Mac addresse <->   IP address 
mapping from IP address to MAC address: ==Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)==

# 3 PROTOCOL ENCAPSULTATION

> Message (http, application layer ) -> segment/datagram (tcp, transport layer ) - > Packet  (ip, network layer )  -> frame  (mac , link layer )

- Protocol encapsulation wraps data with protocol-specific information as it moves through the protocol layers of a network model like TCP/IP
- Each layer adds its own header with control information to fulfi ll the functions of the respective layer, while the protocol data unit (message, segment, packet,...) of the next higher level goes to the body
- At the receiving end, this process is reversed (called decapsulation) to extract the original data
